This is a summer programming project hosted by Software College of Northeastern University, Shenyang, China.

The task is to create a Java program with GUI, that emulates the business of a hospital.

---

The hospital receives patients every day.

The first thing a patient will do is to register for a doctor, and get a history book from the registrar. The patient can be unregistered if they want.

After registering, the patient gets to see the doctor, who fills in a form in his/her history book, and decides which diseases the patient has got. If the doctor can't decide yet, a set of testifications and/or examinations will be added. Those items must be checked in order to continue the diagonosis.

Then the final diagnosis is given by the doctor according to results of exminations and testifications. A list of medicines and/or treatments is also added. The diagnosis is now over, and the patient goes to the pharmacy to get the medicines.

---

*: Examinations, tesitifications, medicines and treatments are all paid items. They are not handed out until the patient pays for them at the registrar's counter. Before these items are consumed, the patient may ask for a refund. In this case, they must return the medicines back to pharmacy if any is handed out to them.
